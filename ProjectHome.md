# mvc-bug-track #
Mvc-bug-track is a web-based issue tracking system written using the ASP.NET MVC3 framework. I created this project mainly to learn more about ASP.NET and add MVC to my resume.

## Notice ##
This is an educational project that is still under development. In it's current state it is **NOT FIT FOR A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT**. If any changes are made to the model classes then the entire database is dropped and re-created at build-time, which will erase any data that you have loaded into it. Obviously this will change as development goes on.

## Issues ##
Any defects or enhancement requests should be submitted using the project's issue tracker above. Please be as descriptive as possible in describing bugs so that I can track them down.

## Releases ##
As stated above, this project is still under development. There is not any kind of "release" yet. If you want to try it you must check out the source and build it using Visual Studio. The only pre-requisites are IIS and SQL Express; but if you have Visual Studio then chances are you have these too.


## Credits ##
